# Talk proposals
A place to propose future talks and gauging interest in JavaScript-related topics.

Interested in hearing about a specific topic at a future meetup? React, Vue, Angular, TypeScript, Deno, Node.js, Web Components, Static Site Generators, etc... If it's JavaScript-related, let's talk about it!

Post it as an issue here and we'll close them off as we go!

Interested in presenting a topic? Assign yourself to the issue and contact an organizer to work it into the schedule.

And remember, have fun!
